# language-eno

Complete language support for [Eno](https://eno-lang.org), featuring
thoroughly crafted custom syntax highlighting behaviour, as well as practical
features to aid with authoring different languages when they are embedded
inside Eno documents.

## Embedded language support

If you are using an embedded language inside your Eno documents, you can
provide its language scope name(s) in language-eno's plugin settings to get
syntax highlighting for your embedded language within embeds in Eno
documents.

Also there's a setting to disable Pulsar's default behaviour of trailing
whitespace removal for Eno documents, which is usually not wanted when markup
languages like markdown are used.

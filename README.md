# language-eno

This package adds syntax highlighting for the [eno notation language](https://eno-lang.org), supplying both a grammar as well as custom styles targeted specifically at eno's syntax scopes.

The eno-specific color scheme was designed to work on both bright and dark backgrounds, but do let me know if you have any issues with readability on a specific color scheme you are using, we can gladly look into improving compatibility even further or even into providing multiple color scheme options in the future.
